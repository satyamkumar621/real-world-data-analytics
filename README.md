Data Analytics project 

📌 Project Overview

This project explores Walmart Sales data to identify key trends, seasonality, and business insights. The analysis focuses on understanding how factors like holidays, fuel prices, temperature, and unemployment affect sales.

The objective is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), build visualizations, and extract insights to support data-driven decision-making.
